 * All members will read and try to understand, bring questions, suggestions, feedback in discussions (main code club meeting)
 * All codes must be written in Portuguese, because it will facilitate the inclusion of colleagues from Brazil (Portuguese speakers)
 * Regular attendance is essential for a successful learning! All participantes involved that attend meetings actively will have access to the code and references (books, tutorials), and will be members of the public repository.
 * All topics covered MUST BE related to the microbiology field
